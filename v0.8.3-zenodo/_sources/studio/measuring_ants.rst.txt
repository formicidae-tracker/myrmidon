   **fort-studio** *Measurement* workspace

   [1]: *Ant Close-Up View* that allow to specify the virtual shape of
   a given Ant. [2]: *Ant Close-Ups List*, similarly to the *Tag
   Close-Up List*, allows to select a Close-Up for an Ant, but here
   organize Close-Up per Ant instead of per Tag. [3]: The toolbar that
   allow the edition of the measurement. [4] *Measurement Type List* is
   used to define the list of shape types for the Experiment.


The *Measurement* workspace is used to define, view and edit manual
measurement on Ants.

.. note::

   **fort-studio** define a default :obj:`head-tail` measurement that
   cannot be removed as it is used for the pose
   estimation. Additionnal measurement types can be added.
